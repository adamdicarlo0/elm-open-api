# `elm-open-api` [![Build Status](https://github.com/wolfadex/elm-open-api/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wolfadex/elm-open-api/actions?query=branch%3Amain)

For decoding and querying an OpenAPI Document which conforms to the [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/) (OAS). OAS can be generated from backend REST APIs and are used to define the expected behavior of a RESTful API.

OAS can be written in JSON or YAML; currently this pacakge supports parsing the JSON format only.

There are primarily 2 versions of OAS the current 3.X versions, which this package supports, and the legacy 2.X versions, also known as Swagger or Swagger docs. I hope to support the 2.X, Swagger, spec in a future release as there are still numerous APIs that only support 2.X.

For supported versions I attempt to provide a minimal level of validation of the OAS and parsing may fail if it doesn't meet the minimum requirements. Howver you should not expect that a successfully parsed OAS is 100% compliant. E.g. some fields are required if and only if another specific field is present and has a specific value. These are not always validated to be present in those cases but a best attempt is made.

For documentation on what specific values mean in the context of an OAS, please refer to the [official OAS docs](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest).
