**Is this a bug with the Elm package wolfadex/elm-open-api, or the CLI tool elm-open-api?**
These are 2 related but separate tools. This is the Elm package wolfadex/elm-open-api, used
for decoding the Open API spec into Elm types for convenient use in other places. There's
also the related CLI tool [elm-open-api](https://github.com/wolfadex/elm-open-api-cli) by
@wolfadex, which uses this package to generate Elm SDKS.

If this is a bug with the Elm package, you're in the right place! If this is a bug with the
CLI tool, please report that issue here https://github.com/wolfadex/elm-open-api-cli/issues/new/choose
